## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is a quick info blast about me

### What I'm working on

Currently, I'm busy working on my `python-chess` repository.  
I'm trying to get that bishop working and returning a correct list of legal moves.  

### My workflow

I use Git locally on my computer (via the command line), and Neovim to edit my code files.  
I personally find the Github GUI harder to use than Git itself, so I use `git push` to push changes onto these repos.

### Long-term goals

In the long run, I'd like to:

* Do stuff for the FOSS community, though that isn't coming anytime soon
* Probably go to Uni and get some degrees, to persue a career in coding soon
* Have fun doing coding (after all, it is my passion)
